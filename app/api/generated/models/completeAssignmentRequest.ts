 * Worker completes an assignment.
Changes assignment status from "taken" to "completed".
            
CONCURRENCY PROTECTION:
- Uses optimistic locking to detect concurrent modifications
- Validates state transitions before applying changes
- Catches DbUpdateConcurrencyException for race conditions
            
STATE TRANSITION VALIDATION:
- Validates that the result maps to a valid order state transition
- Ensures phase/state compatibility
