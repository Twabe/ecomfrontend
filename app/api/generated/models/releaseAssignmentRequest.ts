/**
 * Worker releases an assignment back to the queue.
Changes assignment status to "released".
Order can then be reassigned to another worker.
            
VALIDATIONS:
- Worker must own the assignment
- Assignment must not be in terminal state
- Checks for dependent assignments (e.g., can't release confirmation if suivi is active)
            
CONCURRENCY PROTECTION:
- Uses optimistic locking to detect concurrent modifications
